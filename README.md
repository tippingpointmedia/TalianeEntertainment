# Taliane Entertainment Website
HTML/CSS Corporate brand site in the commercial film-making industry for a client that is currently being worked on and customized. 
Content Management is highly important to the client to have control over updating the site with future content and online advertisement. So, the front-end architecture of the site is being re-done in order to migrate into a Wordpress CMS that requires the least amount of maintenence as possible.

Things worked on:
* Wireframe new Wordpress theme design (click on *What In Vegas TV - Wordpress CMS Theme Wireframes*): https://tpmedia.mybalsamiq.com/projects
* Reverse-engineer and refactor the original architecture to implement improvements in HTML5/CSS3 code before migration using [htmltowordpress.io](http://htmltowordpress.io)
